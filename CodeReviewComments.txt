Changes and Updates:

1. PlatformUtils -is dependent on JavaFX which does not work for Open JDK. Hence refactored to use Platform Class from com.sun.jna.Platform
2. Moved all source Classes to sanity package instead of default package.
3. Added testng.xml file with classes scope under a new directory resources.
4. Modified pom.xml to include Maven surefire plugin to call testng.xml
5. Added Maven compiler plugin with a target 1.8 for JDK compatibility
6. Updated FlightBookingTest Class as a starting point by moving driver initialization to BeforeClass testng annotation.
7. Driver instantitaion should always happen only after setting Platform environment variable. Hence moved setDriverPath call into BeforClass related init call.
8. Tested and found now that chrome browser is launched successfully but need to correct other parts of test.
